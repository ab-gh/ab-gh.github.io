  I work all day, and get half-drunk at night.<br>
  Waking at four to soundless dark, I stare.<br>
  In time the curtain-edges will grow light.<br>
  Till then I see what's really always there:<br>
  Unresting death, a whole day nearer now,<br>
  Making all thought impossible but how<br>
  And where and when I shall myself die.<br>
  Arid interrogation: yet the dread<br>
  Of dying, and being dead,<br>
  Flashes afresh to hold and horrify.<br>
  The mind blanks at the glare. Not in remorse<br>
  <br>
  - The good not done, the love not given, time<br>
  Torn off unused - nor wretchedly because<br>
  An only life can take so long to climb<br>
  Clear of its wrong beginnings, and may never;<br>
  But at the total emptiness for ever,<br>
  The sure extinction that we travel to<br>
  And shall be lost in always. Not to be here,<br>
  Not to be anywhere,<br>
  And soon; nothing more terrible, nothing more true.<br>
  <br>
  This is a special way of being afraid<br>
  No trick dispels. Religion used to try,<br>
  That vast, moth-eaten musical brocade<br>
  Created to pretend we never die,<br>
  And specious stuff that says No rational being<br>
  Can fear a thing it will not feel, not seeing<br>
  That this is what we fear - no sight, no sound,<br>
  No touch or taste or smell, nothing to think with,<br>
  Nothing to love or link with,<br>
  The anasthetic from which none come round.<br>
  <br>
  <span class="highlight">
    And so it stays just on the edge of vision,<br>
    A small, unfocused blur, a standing chill<br>
    That slows each impulse down to indecision.<br>
    Most things may never happen: this one will,<br>
  </span>
  And realisation of it rages out<br>
  In furnace-fear when we are caught without<br>
  People or drink. Courage is no good:<br>
  It means not scaring others. Being brave<br>
  Lets no one off the grave.<br>
  Death is no different whined at than withstood.<br>
  <br>
  Slowly light strengthens, and the room takes shape.<br>
  It stands plain as a wardrobe, what we know,<br>
  Have always known, know that we can't escape,<br>
  Yet can't accept. One side will have to go.<br>
  Meanwhile telephones crouch, getting ready to ring<br>
  In locked-up offices, and all the uncaring<br>
  Intricate rented world begins to rouse.<br>
  The sky is white as clay, with no sun.<br>
  Work has to be done.<br>
  Postmen like doctors go from house to house.</div>
