  i work all day, and get half-drunk at night.<br>
  waking at four to soundless dark, i stare.<br>
  in time the curtain-edges will grow light.<br>
  till then i see what's really always there:<br>
  unresting death, a whole day nearer now,<br>
  making all thought impossible but how<br>
  and where and when i shall myself die.<br>
  arid interrogation: yet the dread<br>
  of dying, and being dead,<br>
  flashes afresh to hold and horrify.<br>
  <br>
  the mind blanks at the glare. not in remorse<br>
  - the good not done, the love not given, time<br>
  torn off unused - nor wretchedly because<br>
  an only life can take so long to climb<br>
  clear of its wrong beginnings, and may never;<br>
  but at the total emptiness for ever,<br>
  the sure extinction that we travel to<br>
  and shall be lost in always. not to be here,<br>
  not to be anywhere,<br>
  and soon; nothing more terrible, nothing more true.<br>
  <br>
  this is a special way of being afraid<br>
  no trick dispels. religion used to try,<br>
  that vast, moth-eaten musical brocade<br>
  created to pretend we never die,<br>
  and specious stuff that says no rational being<br>
  can fear a thing it will not feel, not seeing<br>
  that this is what we fear - no sight, no sound,<br>
  to touch or taste or smell, nothing to think with,<br>
  nothing to love or link with,<br>
  the anasthetic from which none come round.<br>
  <br>
  <span class="highlight">
    and so it stays just on the edge of vision,<br>
    a small, unfocused blur, a standing chill<br>
    that slows each impulse down to indecision.<br>
    most things may never happen: this one will,<br>
  </span>
  and realisation of it rages out<br>
  in furnace-fear when we are caught without<br>
  people or drink. courage is no good:<br>
  it means not scaring others. being brave<br>
  lets no one off the grave.<br>
  death is no different whined at than withstood.<br>
  <br>
  slowly light strengthens, and the room takes shape.<br>
  it stands plain as a wardrobe, what we know,<br>
  have always known, know that we can't escape,<br>
  yet can't accept. one side will have to go.<br>
  meanwhile telephones crouch, getting ready to ring<br>
  in locked-up offices, and all the uncaring<br>
  intricate rented world begins to rouse.<br>
  the sky is white as clay, with no sun.<br>
  work has to be done.<br>
  postmen like doctors go from house to house.</div>
